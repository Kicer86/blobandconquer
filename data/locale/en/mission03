I001 = Looks like the BioMechs found Tekka the Scout first! Find a way to rescue him.
I002 = Other Blobs can aid you in battle in various ways. Teeka will help you in combat. He has a lot of energy but will teleport any briefly if he takes too much damage.
I003 = Some things, such as the windows here, can be shot. Switch to manual aim mode and move the sight around. It will turn Red over objects than can be hurt.
END
