<H3>Basic Play</H3>

<H4>Movement</H4>

<P>
Blob And Conquer is a 3D game with control of the main character seen through a 3rd person perspective. With the
exception of certain weapons Bob will move and face the direction the player pushes. The game's camera is controlled
by using the left and right camera controls.
</P>

<P>Note that unlike first person shooters and some 3rd person games, Bob's rotation is not controlled by the camera.
Pushing forward, back, left and right will also make Bob move and face relative to the screen. That is to say, pushing up will
alway make Bob move forward, back backwards, and left and right repsectively. Is it recommended that first time
players practice in the Training Map to get used to the controls.</P>

<H4>Using Weapons and Attacking Enemies</H4>

<P>
Bob can lock on to any enemy that he is in range of. Once he is locked on he will maintain the lock and auto face the
enemy. This allows the player to dodge around and fire without having to worry too much about aim (note - certain weapons
do not allow the player to lock on). The lock will be lost if one of the following happens,
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>The enemy moves out of range</LI>
	<LI>The enemy is killed</LI>
	<LI>The line of sight to the enemy is blocked</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Weapons</H4>

<P>
Bob can hold up to four different weapons. One of these will always be his trusty pistol. The pistol is a slow, weak weapon
but has the advantage of being the only weapon that can fired underwater and has unlimited ammo. All other weapons have
limited ammo and more ammo for each must be aquired before they can be used. Ammo for weapons can be gained by defeating
enemies or finding them scattered throughout levels.
</P>

<P>All weapons can be fired at any time by pressing the fire button. The best way to use weapons is by locking on to enemies
(see previous section). When a weapon runs out of ammo the next best weapon is automatically selected (explosives are
skipped).
</P>

<TABLE STYLE="background-color:#000077" CELLSPACING="1" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR STYLE="background-color:#000000"><TD STYLE="width: 10%">Name</TD><TD STYLE="width: 10%">Damage</TD>
<TD STYLE="width: 10%">Rate of Fire</TD><TD>Clip Size</TD><TD>Desciption</TD></TR>

<TR STYLE="background-color:#000000"><TD>Pistol</TD><TD>Low</TD><TD>Low</TD><TD>Unlimited</TD>
<TD>Bob's trusty pistol is a low powered weapon with a slow firing rate. It does however benefit from unlimited
ammo and is the only weapon that can be fired underwater. The weaknesses of the weapon are fairly level with
the advantages of it.</TD></TR>

<TR STYLE="background-color:#000000"><TD>Uzi</TD><TD>Low</TD><TD>High</TD><TD>100</TD>
<TD>One of the two weapons favoured by the BioMechs. The Uzi has a low damage rate (on par with the pistol) but has
a high fire rate. In the hands of a small detachment of Assimilated Blobs, it is a weapon that has claimed many
lives in the Blob army.</TD></TR>

<TR STYLE="background-color:#000000"><TD>Shotgun</TD><TD>Range Dependent</TD><TD>Low</TD><TD>20</TD>
<TD>Another favoured weapon of the BioMechs. The shotgun has a low firing rate but causes a lot of damage at
close range. A close range blast is usually enough to kill any enemy immediately.</TD></TR>

<TR STYLE="background-color:#000000"><TD>Grenade</TD><TD>Range Dependent</TD><TD>Low</TD><TD>8</TD>
<TD>A standard explosive. Causes a lot of damage to those within the target area and additional damage
to those within the impact range. Easily avoided at a distance.</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<H4>Items</H4>

<P>During mission Bob will come across a number of items. These are split in to three distinct categories - Medical,
Utility and Special.</P>

<TABLE STYLE="background-color:#000077" CELLPADDING="5" CELLSPACING="1">
<TR STYLE="background-color:#000000">
	<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="10%">Medical</TD><TD>These take the form of cherries (a Blob's staple diet) and first aid kits (found in BioMech bases).
	Cherries will restore small amounts of health whilst first aid kits will restore a lot more. These items are used
	immediately.</TD>
</TR>
<TR STYLE="background-color:#000000">
	<TD VALIGN="TOP">Utility</TD><TD>Items such as key cards fall in to this category. This items are carried by Bob until they are used (even
	if Bob leaves the current level). Such items are needed by switches and other interactive devices.</TD>
</TR>
<TR STYLE="background-color:#000000">
	<TD VALIGN="TOP">Special</TD><TD>These items are quite rare and/or unique. They can grant Bob (or Teeka) a permanent powerup. Examples of
	these include Shields and additional weaponary for Teeka.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H4>Swimming and Environmental Hazards</H4>

<P>Bob will sometimes need to swim in order to continue his mission or in other to reach a certain point. Bob has limited oxygen when underwater.
Once his oxygen runs out Bob will begin to drown very quickly, so keep an eye on your oxygen levels. Swimming is much the same as moving on land
except that pushing <B>Jump</B> will cause Bob to swim up. Bob will automatically sink if you do not try and swim up.</P>

<P>Be aware that whilst in water the only weapon that Bob can use is the Pistol. All other weapons will fail to fire. He cannot even throw
grenades underwater.</P>

<P>As well as water Bob's homeworld is also populated by areas of slime and lava. Both of these are bad for Bob's health and he cannot swim
in either of these. If Bob falls in to either of them he will lose some health and then be placed back in to the last safe place he was in
before his fall.</P>

<H4>Being Stunned</H4>

<P>When Bob is stunned you will briefly lose control of him. Whilst stunned Bob will tumble helplessly for a period of time and will stop
once his lands back on the ground or in water. Bob is completely helpless whilst he is stunned and is still able to take damage. This means
that enemies and environments can still cause him harm.</P>

<P>Bob will become stunned under the following circumstances,</P>
<UL>
	<LI>He is within the radius of an explosion.</LI>
	<LI>He takes large amount of damage within a small period of time</LI>
	<LI>As a result of a weapon (stun grenade) or other attack designed to do so.</LI>
</UL>
