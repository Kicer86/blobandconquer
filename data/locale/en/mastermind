To activate this switch you will need to work your way past the security system. You must match your
colours with the current security colour system. To do this, click on the slots of the current
highlighted row to rotate the colour lamps. When you are ready to guess, click the ? on the right hand
side of the row. The ? will then show the
number of colour lamps that you correctly guessed. You will need to keep trying
colours until you get all of them right. The switch will maintain the same colour code, so if
you fail the code will not change the next time you try.
