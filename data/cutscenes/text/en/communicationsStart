[Scene01]

Following the destruction of the Biomech Supply Depot, Bob set his sights on his next
target: the Communications Base. Accessing the base was going to prove difficult however
as the base was surrounded by a lake of molten lava and the entrance heavily defended.
Either Bob would have to find another way inside... or make one.

[Scene02]

The base's shielding prevented Blobs from being teleported in and Bob would need to
disable it to allow Anderson and his hacking skills inside. The base also contained a
prison housing many MIAs awaiting transportation to the Biomech Assimilator. Bob would
need to rescue them before he ventured further inside to commence demolition...
