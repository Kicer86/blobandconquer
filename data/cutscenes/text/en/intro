[Scene01]

Spurred on by Bob's victory over Galdov, the Blobs once again took up arms
and began the fight back for their world. The battles ranged from wide
and far, to long and bloody, and the Blobs took many causalities along
the way. Still they did not give up.

[Scene02]

Eventually the time came when the Blobs were in a position to begin their
strikes against the Biomech's four main strong holds: The Biomech 
Supply Depot, the Biomech Communcations, the Biomech Assimilator and
the Biomech Tower. Information was gathered and preparations were made...

[Scene03]

Then one day, Teeka the Scout did not return. A highly reliable Blob,
able to handle themselves in even the most precarious of situations,
Bob found the absence unsettling.

[Scene04]

On a dark and stormy night, Bob set out alone across the Cherry Fields, 
Teeka's last known location, and began a systematic sweep to see
if he could find any clue as to his ally's whereabouts.

[Scene05]

And though he searched meticulously, Bob was unable to find anything
that might indicate what had become of his friend. A feeling of
great unease began to grow within him as he looked further. He
could not help thinking that he had been led into a trap.

[Scene06]

Atop the hills that enclosed the Cherry Fields that Bob walked, 
dozens of eyes peered down. The gears of a terrible plan began
to be put into motion, one that might seal the Blob's fate
forever...
