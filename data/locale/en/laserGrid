Click on the bulbs to reveal their colours. You may only light two bulbs at
a time. If the bulbs' lights do not match then they will switch back off. You
must match all the bulb light pairs in order to proceed. A time limit will
start once you click on the first bulb. If the time runs out before you have
lite all the bulbs then you will fail and have to try again. The switch
will be activated when you have successfully matched all pairs.
