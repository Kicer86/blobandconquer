[Galdov 1]
Are you getting a feeling of déjà vu, Bob?

[Galdov 2]
No where for you to escape to today. You will
die here with me...

[Galdov 3]
Accept your death...!

[Galdov 4]
NO!!!!!!!

[STORY 1]
The Tower fell, but as the smoke cleared the Blobs
discovered that Galdov had yet again survived. Posing
no threat the Blobs gathered around the enemy leader to
hear what he had to say...

[Galdov 5]
I applaud you, Bob. You truly are a formidable
opponent.

[Galdov 6]
You have laid my forces to waste; Destroyed my bases
of operation and humiliated me once more.
You wanted nothing more than freedom for your race
and you have fought hard to earn it.

[Galdov 7]
The Elders did well when they entrusted
you with the task of defending your race.

[Galdov 8]
Ha! You truly do not remember do you? Is
1000 years really too long for your
mortal memory?

[Galdov 9]
Did none of you ever find it strange? Did none
of you seek to question how a single one of you
could so easily oppose and take down an army
that threatened to enslave you for all eternity?

[Galdov 10]
Very well, Bob. I will grant you your victory...

[Galdov 11]
But we both know that this is not where or how
it will all end. You know what must be done.

[Galdov 12]
I will await you at the beginning, Bob, and I
can wait forever. You cannot escape your destiny.

[STORY 2]
With that Galdov left the Blob's homeworld forever,
freeing those that were cursed with his assimilation
and returning them to themselves.

[STORY 3]
The Blobs returned home, relieved that their war
was over and that they could at last return to the peace
that they had known before Galdov's arrival.

[STORY 4]
But as the celebrations began there was one Blob
whose conscience was far from clear, ancient
memories finally unlocked.

[STORY 5]
As Bob stood looking onwards in to the cave, the four Crystals
by his side, he knew in his heart that his final
and most difficult battle was just beginning.

[STORY 6]
In order to complete the task that had been
entrusted to him, Bob would have to return back
to his original homeworld...

[STORY 7]
... cross the Lava Seas of Byleath...

[STORY 8]
... traverse the wilds of the Plains of Sorrow...

[STORY 9]
... scale the rocky cliffs of Mount Kalash...

[STORY 10]
... enter the Chamber of the Firsts...

[STORY 11]
... and destroy a god.
