[Scene01]

With the Supply and Communications bases destroyed Bob turned his attentions to
the enemy's most important areas of operation - The Assimilator. Countless numbers
of Blobs from across the planet had been brought here to be turned in to 
soldiers to fight Galdov's senseless war. Bob would put an end to all of that today.

[Scene02]

Anderson had been captured along with a number of recent allies and Bob knew he
would have to effect the Blob's release if he was going to be successful in his
mission. The Assimilator would be full of MIAs awaiting transformation and he would
attempt to rescue as many as possible.

[Scene03]

As he and Teeka approached the outskirts of the base and the Biomech forces
came rushing forward a thought occurred to him - If it was possible to turn a
Blob in to a Biomech soldier then it may be possible to change one back. The
enemy would no doubt have such a device and it would merely be a case of finding it...
