At last...

[Galdov 2]
I must say I'm disappointed with your progress.
I imagined you'd have been here sooner.

[Galdov 3]
Tell me, Bob, what did you truly believe you
could achieve by coming here today?

[Galdov 4]
My surrender? My death? You have no hope of
either of those. The destruction of my tower is
one thing but my own defeat is by far another.
 
[Galdov 5]
Your friends may well be celebrating their victories
tonight...

[Galdov 6]
But I can promise you, Bob, that you will not
be joining them.

[Galdov 7]
Now...

[Galdov 8]
Let's finish this!
