[Scene01]

As the Eyedroid Commander lay in ruins in the courtyard of the Blobs'
home base, Bob realised that now was the time to begin their new
offensive. Targeting the enemy bases that he had previously infiltrated,
Bob put together a small strike team to end the Biomech's reign of terror.

[Scene02]

Bob, along with Teeka, would fight their way in to the enemy forts utilising
the talents of other skilled Blobs. As he approached the lower slopes of the enemy
base Bob hoped that Spark Plug would be able to get them inside and that
the explosives Arnold had prepared would be enough to bring down the structure.
