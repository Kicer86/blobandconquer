[Galdov 1]
The stupidity of your race still deeply amuses me, Bob.
Surprised to see me? You should know by now that I cannot be
so easily defeated.

[Galdov 2]
There never was a Life Crystal - I orchestrated the entire
event so that I may have the pleasure of killing you myself.
You may have your small victories but this war is far from
over.

[Galdov 3]
When you left me to be destroyed on that space station you
were merely setting me back. Whilst I waited for my strength
to return I devised a plan to lure you, unsuspecting, in to
a position where you would be most vulnerable.

[Galdov 4]
The last time we met you had destroyed my valued forces,
taken what was rightfully mine and raised an army against
me.

[Galdov 5]
But more than anything, Bob, you humiliated me.

[Galdov 6]
You took my honour; My majesty; My grace; And reduced me to
a pitiful shell.

[Galdov 7]
But this time my friend there will be no running...

[Galdov 8]
Only one of us will walk away from this battle and unlike our
previous battle, it will not be you.

[Galdov 9]
And now, Bob... Where were we..?!
