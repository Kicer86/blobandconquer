<H3>Completing Objectives</H3>

<P>Completing objectives is the key to finishing missions in Blob and Conquer. Objectives can range from collecting
a number of items to defeating a particular enemy. Once you have completed an objective you will recieve an on screen
notification to let you know that you have done so.</P>

<P>To view objectives open the Status window. The objectives that are valid for the mission you are on will be
listed there. There are two types of objective, Primary and Secondary.</P>

<P><B STYLE="color:#AAAAFF">Primary Objectives</B> are the mission's main objective. In most cases they must be completed before you can
proceed on to the next level.</P>

<P><B STYLE="color:#AAAAFF">Secondary Objectives</B> can be completed if the player wishes. Whilst not needed to finish the level they
will usually provide the player with some kind of reward for the effort.</P>
