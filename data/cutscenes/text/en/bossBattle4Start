Going somewhere, Bob?

[Galdov 2]
I have to hand it to you - Your determination
is certainly something to be admired. But
determination doesn't always lead to victory.

[Galdov 3]
The destruction of the Assimilator is of 
little consequence. Another can always be
built.

[Galdov 4]
Just as I have done with these Crystals.

[Galdov 5]
You may have thwarted my earlier attempts to
reclaim the originals, but with the remnants of knowledge
from the Reality Crystal still in my mind, I have
constructed these effective substitutes.

[Galdov 6]
War, Death, Conquest, Famine. You should, by now,
be more than familiar with those ideals. Fitting
names for my Crystals indeed.

[Galdov 7]
I have fought many in my time, Bob, and they
have all fallen to my power and my will. And
you and your race shall be no different.

[Galdov 8]
But perhaps you need a little more convincing..?

[Galdov 9]
I hope you enjoy playing with my two latest creations. I'm sure
they will keep you occupied for a good while.

[Galdov 10]
And in the unlikely event that you do survive your memory may
be a little less fuzzy...
