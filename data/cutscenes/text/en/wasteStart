[Scene01]

Bob had found Teeka the Scout, a Blob who was often dispatched to investigate
enemy movements and positions. Though usually careful, the Blob had been captured 
and was awaiting transfer to the Biomech Assimilator. Now freed, Teeka would make a useful
sidekick to Bob as the pair made their way home.

[Scene02]

They now found themselves within a Biomech facility apparently used for
post processing and disposal services. Bob figured that there must be a sewer
system located beneath, through which they could make their escape. But first
he would need to ensure that Teeka was properly equipped to handle their predicament.
