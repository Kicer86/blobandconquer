AUTO = The BioMechs have set up an ambush! You'll need to clear the ambush and then find a way back home!
I001 = This is a Save Point. To use it step inside the light column and press ACTION to save. Some Save Points will have to be activated before they can be used.
I002 = Make sure you pick up additional weapons. The pistol is unlimited but fairly weak. All other weapons have ammo limits. Ammo can be gained from pickups and by defeating enemies.
I003 = Enemies cannot see you if you are standing behind walls or other obstacles. You can see this to your advantage when in combat situations.
I004 = The BioMechs have sealed off your way home! You can still get home through the caves though.
END
