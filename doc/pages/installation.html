</PRE>

<P>Most Linux users will find that the required SDL libraries came with their system and are 
probably already installed. If not, click the name of the library above to go to the relevant 
homepage. OpenGL drivers are generally provided by your graphics card's vendor (for example
ATI or Nvidia). These can be downloaded from your vendor's homepage. Blob and Conquer does not
support software OpenGL and it is <B>NOT</B> recommended that you attempt to play the game
with no hardware acceleration.</P>

<A NAME="installation"></A><H3>Installation</H3>

<P><I>(Note - These instruction refer to Linux / Unix environments. Other operating 
systems may vary)</I></P>

<P>There are two main methods of installation available - Installing using a binary RPM and
compiling the game from source.</P>

<H4>Installing using an RPM</H4>

<P>This is the easiest and most likely the preferred method of installation for most users.
Depending on your desktop environment (eg - KDE, Gnome) you may be able to install the game by
double clicking on the RPM file icon and following the onscreen instructions. You can also
install the game by using the command line (remember to change the filename to match the name 
of the package you are installing),</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">rpm -U blobAndConquer-x.x-x.i586.rpm</P>

<P>Provided you have all the required libraries installed the game should install without problems.
Be aware that in order to perform the above command you will be required to have root user access.</P>

<H4>Installation from Source</H4>

<P>If you choose this method you will need to build the game from source. This will require all the appropriate
development libraries (see Requirements) and some knowledge of building an application using the source code.
Open a terminal and use the following commands to extract, compile and install the game (again remember to change the
filename to match the name of the download),</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">
tar xzf blobAndConquer-x.x-x.tar.gz<BR>
cd blobAndConquer-x.x-x<BR>
make<BR>
make install<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">*</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P>Depending on the speed of your computer (and other factors that may limit the compiler time), you
may have to wait a few minutes for the initial "make" command to complete whilst the game's source
code is compiled. Once this has [successfully] completed you can run the "make install" command. If
whilst running either of these steps the process aborts check the error message to see if you are
missing any development files or check the Trouble Shooting section for more help.</P>

<I>* - Root access is required to perform this step</I>

<A NAME="running"></A><H3>Running the Game</H3>

<P>Both and KDE and Gnome desktop environments (and maybe others) should have a new menu entry
called Blob And Conquer. This can be found under Games / Tactics & Strategy (or there abouts). You
can also run the game from a terminal prompt by typing,</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">
blobAndConquer
</P>

<P>Additional commands for running the game are available when running the game from the command
prompt. See the section on Additonal Command Line Options for more details.</P>

<H3>Root Access</H3>

<P>In order to install the game using either of the above methods you be required to have root access
rights to the machine. You can temporarily switch the the root user by typing,</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">
su
</P>

<P>and providing the root password. You will then be able to install the game. Remember to exit from
the root user mode by typing,</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">
exit
</P>

<P>It is <B>NOT</B> recommended you be the root user for any longer than you need be.</P>

<H3>Misc Installation Information</H3>

<P>The game is installed using the following directory structure. If you experience problems
getting the game to run, please check your paths are correct.</P>

<P STYLE="font-family: monospace">
/usr/games/blobAndConquer<BR>
/usr/share/games/parallelrealities/blobAndConquer.pak<BR>
/usr/share/doc/blobAndConquer/*<BR>
</P>

<P>Saved games and configuration data are saved to,</P>

<P STYLE="font-family: monospace">
{USER_HOME}/.parallelrealities/blobAndConquer/<BR>
