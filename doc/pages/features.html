<H3>Mission Features and Elements</H3>

<P>Bob will encounter a number of structures and entities during his missions. A selection of these are below,</P>

<H4>Doors</H4>

<P>Doors open when Bob walks up to them, unless they are locked. If a door is locked it can be opened in a number of ways,</P>

<UL>
	<LI>By using a switch</LI>
	<LI>By completing an objective</LI>
</UL>

<P>In some cases you may have to find another way around if the door cannot be opened by any direct means.</P>

<H4>Switches</H4>

<P>Switches can be interacted with by using the Action button. They are either On or Off. When a switch is activated or deactivated
it usually has an effect on an object within the level. For example a switch may open a door or activate a teleporter. Some switches
may require an item before they can be used, others may be timed and so they will only stay activated for a certain amount of time.
</P>

<H4>Teleporters</H4>

<P>Like all good teleporters, this will transport Bob and other entities in its range to a new location. To use a teleporter simply
walk in to it. The appear as columns of light with colored particles flowing upwards from their base.</P>

<H4>Energy Barriers</H4>

<P>Rather like doors enery barriers will prevent unauthorised access to an area. Energy barriers must be deactivated by either completing
an objective or by using a switch.</P>

<H4>Information Points</H4>

<P>Used to deliver hints and tips to the player as well as giving them information about the current situation. They can be activated
by standing on them and pressing the ACTION button. They appear as small yellow columns on the ground.</P>

<H4>Save Points</H4>

<P>Scattered around the levels are save points. Aside from when moving levels these are the only places where the player may save
their game (for more information see <A HREF="saving.html">Loading and Saving</A>). They appear as blue columns of light which glow
brighter when Bob is within one. Press the ACTION button to bring up the Save Game dialog. Save points may be used as many times
as you wish.</P>

<H4>Exit Points</H4>

<P>Exit points allow Bob to exit one level and move on to another one. Depending on the situation you may not be able to use the
exit point. For example, the exit point in the Training map may not be used until the player has completed the Combat Training 
objective.</P>

<H4>Misc Structures</H4>

<P>Other structures, such a bridge, exist in the game. Some can be damaged and destroyed and may be required to be so or defended
according to mission objectives.</P>
