## Media files

BW:BaC has always been a Free Software game, at least that was the intention.
However, the original graphics and sounds were taken from various sources on the Internet,
and unfortunately most did not have a license that allowed them to be redistributed,
or placed limitations on how they could be used.
Therefore, all the original media files have been removed,
and we are still in the process of replacing them with new media files.
While the game is technically still playable, it might not be enjoyable at the moment.

You can help us by searching for replacement sound, music and textures that are appropriately licensed
(Public Domain, CC0, BSD, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA and GPL).
We cannot use media files which have no copyright statement, or which have a proplematic license
(for example, CC-Sampling+ and any CC license with NC and/or ND clauses).
Have a look at `README-DATA.md` and `CREDITS-DATA`.
