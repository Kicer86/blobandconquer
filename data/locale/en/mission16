I001 = The SpiderBlob Commander is known to have poor shield units. It might see you as a serious threat if you wear them down...
I002 = The Commander's armour is too strong for normal weapons. But maybe if he could be lured over one of the lava pits...
I003 = Whilst the Commander's armour is strong, its legs aren't. A big enough explosion could knock him down and stun him briefly...
