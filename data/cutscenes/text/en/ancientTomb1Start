[Scene01]

After defeating the evil Spider Blob Commander, Bob and Teeka returned to base with their
newly acquired map. As Bob studied the map carefully he discovered that it pointed to
a 5th Ancient Tomb. Bob had always assumed that there were only 4 tombs and
only 4 Crystals.

[Scene02]

Bob lost no time in heading back out in to the field, eager to arrive at the Tomb
before the enemy. The map spoke of the Life Crystal, a Crystal more powerful than any
of the others he currently held in his possession. Bob had already witnessed the
power of one of the Crystals in enemy hands, and knew he could not afford for it to happen again.
