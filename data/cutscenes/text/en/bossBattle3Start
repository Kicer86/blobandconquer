[STORY 1]
Bob and Teeka had narrowly escaped the destruction of
the BioMech Communications base. But now they found
themselves deep underground and in unfamiliar
territory.

[STORY 2]
Despite their unknown location Bob and Teeka decided
to press forward and find a way home. The area bore all the
hallmarks of a disused BioMech facility and there would
no doubt be a way out.

[STORY 3]
A noise behind Bob caught his attention...

[STORY 4]
The map that lay before Bob looked important. He decided
that he would take it with him and examine it more
closely back at the Blob's base.
