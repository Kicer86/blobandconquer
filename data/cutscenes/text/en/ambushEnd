ugh... My powers must not have fully returned yet!
This is far from over, Bob. Mark my words I will
be there at every twist and turn of your worthless
little life!

[Galdov 2]
Before I go, Bob, I have a question for you...

[Galdov 3]
Do you remember? Because even after all these years
I have not forgotten...

[STORY 3]
Galdov departed as suddenly as he had first appeared
but his question lingered with Bob all the way back
home. What did the leader of the alien forces mean?
What did he remember? And what was it Galdov wanted him to?
