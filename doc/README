Blob Wars : Blob and Conquer V0.4
=================================

This is the third release of Blob and Conquer.

Note that the manual is incorrect in places since it lists up coming features.


Compiling
---------

untar the archive and change in to the directory
run make to build the game
run with ./blobAndConquer


Installation
------------

Blob and Conquer does not need to be installed at this time.



Playing
-------

You can use the mouse and keyboard to play the game (see the manual for default controls).

The game has been developed using a PS2 joypad so mouse and keyboard controls might be a little
tricky at this stage.

This release contains all of the games main missions. Boss battles are not included in this release
but will make it in to the game before V1.0

The final mission cannot be completed. Upon finishing the final objective gameplay will simply continue.


Changes
-------

* Added decals (for blood splats, etc.)
* Fixed collision detection routine to remove random crashes
* Added extra configuration options
* Fixed Enemy Base 2, part 3 so it does not loop around on itself on completion
* Fixed other collision detection issues
* Added in music for time limits
* Added in more music
* Added in item supply crates
* Blobs can no longer use switches that require special items
* Added some more sound effects
* Possible fixes for 64 bit and non x86 chips (needs to be road tested by players)
* Lots of misc little fixes


Bugs
----

Patches to fix bugs are welcome. Patches to alter the gameplay (such as changing weapon strengths, etc) will be rejected.
